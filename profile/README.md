<h3 align="center"><strong>The ChatGPT Team alternative that talks to any Large Language Model.</strong></h3>

[Joia](https://joia.so/) is a collaborative alternative to ChatGPT, designed from the ground up for team collaboration. It open source and has the added benefit that can connect to any Large Language Model; including those provided by OpenAI, OpenRouter, HuggingFace and Amazon Bedrock.

## Main features & benefits

- Easy to give access to LLMs like ChatGPT to entire teams.
- Use the latest open source LLMs like Llama 2, Mixtral and others.
- Create collaborative chatbots for specific use cases, and share them across your teams.
- Savings estimated of 50%-75% (depends on usage), when compared to ChatGPT Plus.
- Speed. Our benchmarks indicate that responses are on average 40% faster than ChatGPT Plus.
- Privacy. When using OpenAI models, your data is not used for training purposes. Similarly, when using other LLMs providers, your data is not used for training purposes.

## Getting started

#### Cloud

The easiest way to get started with Joia is with [our official managed service in the cloud](https://joia.so/). At the moment it is completely free to use without limits, although we have plans to introduce a pricing model in the future.

In the cloud version you can either use your own API keys for LLM provider, or purchase credits with us.

Our cloud version can save a substantial amount of developer time and resources. We think it's the de-facto solution for mot customers and the value option. Plus, any future revenues will go towards the funding nad maintenance of Joia. Youâ€™ll be supporting open source software and getting a great service!

#### Vercel

Vercel is the easiest way to deploy Joia. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Create a project by clicking on **Add New... > Project**.
2. Select **Import Third-Party Git Repository** and enter the URL of this repository.
3. Insert the environment variables. To do so, use `.env.example` as a reference for the variables to fill in. You'll need to set the `DATABASE_URL` variable to point to your Postgres database, which you can provision with Vercel.
4. Deploy the project.
5. Set up your domain to point to the Vercel deployment.

#### Fully self-hosted

To self host a Joia app you'll need to follow the next steps:

1. Provision a Postgres database. The details may vary based on your stup.
2. Clone or copy this repository.
3. Create an `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file. You'll need to set the `DATABASE_URL` variable to point to your Postgres database.
4. Install the dependencies by running `yarn install`.
5. Build the NextJS app by running `yarn production:build`. This will prepare NextJS to be built and run the build itself.
6. Run a post-install script by running `yarn production:postbuild`. This script will run the migrations.
7. Bootstrap the app by running `yarn production:start`.
